Today I learned how to move sparse matrices out of R to python/Spark along with
some quirks along the way in terms of the libsvm file format.

Writing out sparse matrices to R, the most straightforward package is `sparsio`
and the functions to use are `read_svmlight()` and `write_svmlight()`.

**Note**: This format (I'm not sure if it is particular to libsvm or just the svm
light format) writes large numbers in scientific notation *and* limits the
significant digits to 6. Therefore, if you have numbers larger than 1,000,000,
they will lose the last digit.

Reading libsvm in Spark is relatively straightforward:
`spark.read.format('libsvm').load(<path>)` 

The features are read in as one vector column. They can be converted to an
array column with the following function and lines of code:
``
def to_array(col):
    def to_array_(v):
        return v.toArray().tolist()
    return udf(to_array_, ArrayType(DoubleType()))(col)

df = df_old.withColumn("xs", to_array(f.col("features"))) \
    .select([f.col("xs")[i] for i in range(len(colnames))])``

This pulls out all of the parts of the array into separate columns.
